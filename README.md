# Mirage
Mirage is an open privacy frontend to Miraheze. It uses an extremely light interface, focused on accessibility and ease of reading. Font size can be increased, and it has an easy-on-the-eyes dark mode. This configuration is done with cookies that never leave a browser.

Keep in mind Mirage is heavily WIP.

Urls use the exact same format as Breezewiki.
